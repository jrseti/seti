/**
 * @name MarkerClusterer for Flash
 * @version 1.0
 * @author Xiaoxi Wu
 * @copyright (c) 2009 Xiaoxi Wu
 * @fileoverview
 * Ported from Javascript to Actionscript 3 by Sean Toru
 * Ported for use in Flex (removal of fl. libraries) by Ian Watkins
 * Reflectored for both Flash and Flex, 
 * and maintained by Juguang XIAO (juguang@gmail.com)
 * 
 * This actionscript library creates and manages per-zoom-level 
 * clusters for large amounts of markers (hundreds or thousands).
 * This library was inspired by the <a href="http://www.maptimize.com">
 * Maptimize</a> hosted clustering solution.
 * <br /><br/>
 * <b>How it works</b>:<br/>
 * The <code>MarkerClusterer</code> will group markers into clusters according to
 * their distance from a cluster's center. When a marker is added,
 * the marker cluster will find a position in all the clusters, and 
 * if it fails to find one, it will create a new cluster with the marker.
 * The number of markers in a cluster will be displayed
 * on the cluster marker. When the map viewport changes,
 * <code>MarkerClusterer</code> will destroy the clusters in the viewport 
 * and regroup them into new clusters.
